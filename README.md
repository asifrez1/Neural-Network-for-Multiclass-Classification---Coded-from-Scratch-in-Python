# Neural Network for Multiclass Classification - Coded from Scratch in Python

This project implements the core ideas of Computer Vision and Neural Networks in Python. It did not use any custom libraries/packages that are available for deep learning algorithm. It was built from scratch with the help of common Python packages like Pandas and NumPy. This code works for any number of hidden layers for multiclass classification. Some hyper-parameter tuning was done to find the best architecture. I have used MNIST Dataset that contains images of handwritten digits and has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. This code is able to recognize the characters with certain amount of accuracy using artificial intelligence. 

The codes include:
- Vectorization
- Only iterations (no convergence condition)
- Multi-class problem - used softmax and cross entropy
- Code works for any number of hidden layers provided as input
- L2 regularization
